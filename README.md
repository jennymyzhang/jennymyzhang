# Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸŒ± Hi, I'm Jenny! I'm currently an undergraduate studying Computer Science and Finance at the University of Waterloo.

I love building projects in **Python** and have experience working with libraries such as Yahoo Finance, Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

In my spare time, I enjoy singing, dancing, and spending time with my puppy at home.
