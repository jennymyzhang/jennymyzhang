# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Hi, I'm Jenny! I'm currently an undergraduate studying [Computer Science and Finance](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/computing-and-financial-management) at the University of Waterloo.

I love building projects in **Python** and have experience working with libraries such as [Yahoo Finance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

I'm currently learning **web development** (HTML, CSS, JS, and React) to create web applications that benefit the lives of others.

In my spare time, I enjoy singing, dancing, and spending time with my puppy at home.
